Corrections that were made:

1. Variable naming consistency the issue was mtgPayment is used in startUp() but mortgagePayment is used elsewhere. The correction I made was mortgagePayment consistently. 

2. The function names in the while loop and their definitions should match exactly. The corrections was made to ensure consistent naming and correct function calls. 

3. Initialization of mortgagePayment is not initialized before the while loop. 

4. Initialization the U in startUp at StartUp().

5. Corrected the loop condition. The while loop condition used not equal to instead of <>.
The correction changed not equal to to <> to match the correct pseudocode syntax.
