The corrections made:
1. Initialization of firstTest. The issue was the firstTest statement is missing before the while loop. I added firstTest to initialize the loop condtion.

2. Average calculation: the issue was average = firstTest + secondTest / 2 is incorrect due to operator precedence (division will occur before addition). The correction I made was I changed it to average = (firstTest + secondTest) / 2 to ensure proper calculation. 

3. There was a typo on the word output on the line output "Average is", average. 
 
4. Corrected the loop condition. The while loop condition used not equal to instead of <>.
The correction changed not equal to to <> to match the correct pseudocode syntax.
